## Features

Generate C#/.NET Xunit test class with test methods. If test-driven development (TDD) wasn't followed initially, use Development-Driven Testing (DDT) to generate test classes and test methods to increase code coverage and decrease technical debt.

## Requirements

- C#/.NET project with Xunit test project.
    - Test projects must have property `IsTestProject` set to `true` to be recognized as a test project.
    - Multiple test projects are supported.
- Tech debt; missing unit tests. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Extension Settings

- `ddt.indicateTypeNullability`
    - Appends `?` to types that can be assigned `null`.
- `ddt.objectTypeForGenericParameters`
    - Replace generic parameters (e.g. `T`, `T1`, `TKey`, etc) with `object`.
- `ddt.reservedMethodNames`
    - If a class has a method with one of these names, its test method will include the `new` modifier.
- `ddt.testClassNamePrefixIfFileAlreadyExists`
    - If a test class file already exists, this prefix will be added to the test class name and appended to the file.
- `ddt.typesNotToBeIndicatedAsNullable`
    - If `ddt.indicateTypeNullability` is `true`, these types will not be indicated as nullable.
- `ddt.useOnlyNewOperatorForInstanceInstantiation`
    - Beginning with C# 9.0, constructor invocation expressions are target-typed. That is, if a target type of an expression is known, you can omit a type name. This setting will use only the `new` operator for instance instantiation.
- `ddt.warningsToDisable`
    - Warnings to disable in generated test classes.

## Known Issues/Limitations

Most, if not all, of the following you can append "... (for now)". As in, these will be addressed.

- Does not account for (as in include) public methods on base classes.
- Does not take advantage of interfaces used on classes.
- Not using mocks where applicable.
