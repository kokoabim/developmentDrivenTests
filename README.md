## Extension Settings

- ddt.indicateTypeNullability

## Known Issues

Most, if not all, you can append "... (for now)." to the following. As in, these will be addressed.

- A _lot_ is assumed.
- Copies to clipboard. Does not generate, nor write to, files.
- Does not account for public methods on base classes.
- Does not take advantage of interfaces used on classes.
- Not automatically using mocks where applicable.
- If multiple namespaces exist in a file, only the last with a public class is captured to the clipboard.
